## [About](#index)

Timed is a basic extension for Chrome web browser aimed at time related features, specifically timers, stopwatches, and alarms.

\*Chrome extensions are solely available for the browser, thereby the necessity of browser fallbacks is fairly limited.

> Extensions are zipped bundles of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other files used in the web platform, that customize the Google Chrome browsing experience. Extensions are built using web technology and can use the same APIs the browser provides to the open web.
